# Expenses App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app can keep track of all your expenses and income sources. Based on the tutorial from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ), currently exploring ways to extend on the tutorial's app.

This app uses React's Context API to create a global state and hand it down to all components in the app. This app currently does not have a backend and cannot store information across separate browsing sessions, but this may change in the future.
